## <a id="Description">Description:</a>

### Project Overview
The Cocktail App React project is a single-page web application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The app provides a directory of cocktail recipes, as well as a cocktail bar locator. Users can browse cocktail recipes and learn how to make their favorite drinks, or search for cocktail bars in their area.

### Technologies Used
The app uses a number of external npm packages to provide additional functionality. These include axios for making HTTP requests, bootstrap and react-bootstrap for styling and layout, cors for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and express for creating a proxy server to interact with external APIs. Additionally, react-router-dom is used to enable client-side routing, and react-reveal and react-typed are used for animation and typing effects, respectively.
### Development Process
This project was developed by a team of three developers using Git and GitHub for version control. We followed an agile development methodology and worked on features independently before merging them into the main branch.

### Purpose and Target Audience
Overall, the Cocktail App React project is a useful tool for anyone who wants to learn more about making cocktails or finding cocktail bars in their area. With its clean and responsive design, intuitive user interface, and comprehensive directory of cocktail recipes, the app is a great for anyone looking to experiment with their next alchohilic beverage.
